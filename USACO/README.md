# USACO

These are the USACO soluions. The Train folder contains solutions to the training problems. The actual contest problems are in the folder of the (December contest year)_(Other contest year). Some of my much older solutions are in the Unorganized folder, which contains a lot of random problems that are yet to be organized.
